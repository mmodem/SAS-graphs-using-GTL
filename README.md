# SAS-graphs-using-GTL
Sample data and GTL code to create graphs
These files are provided as a support documentation for our paper 'Graphs made easy using SAS Graph Template Language'. We provided programs, dummy input data, output files (figures). The idea is to help the programmer recreate these graphs by themselves and play with the code to see how different options/statements work. 
Dummy data to create these is present in " ".
There are 10 sas programs to create these figures. You may need to update the path for input and output as you save this information in you computers.
All the outputs are stored in the file " ".
